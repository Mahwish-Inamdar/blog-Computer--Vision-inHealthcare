      <!-- How Computer Vision Works Section -->
      <section id="how-computer-vision-works">
        <h2>3. How Computer Vision Works in Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Computer vision in healthcare operates by analyzing medical images—such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and even live video feeds during surgeries. The process starts with capturing visual data from these sources, which is then processed through deep learning algorithms designed to recognize patterns and abnormalities. </p>
        <h3>Here's a breakdown of how it works:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Visual data, like medical scans or live surgical feeds, is collected from various sources. This could include imaging devices, cameras, or real-time video streams.</li>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The collected images are cleaned and enhanced to ensure that the data is of high quality. This includes removing noise from the images and improving resolution for accurate analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Machine learning models identify important features in the image, such as the presence of tumors, fractures, or other anomalies. These features are compared against large datasets of medical images to determine if they are normal or indicative of a medical condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Classification & Prediction:</strong> The computer vision system classifies the image based on the features it detects. For example, it might predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign by comparing it to similar cases in the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Processing & Analysis:</strong>Once the classification is complete, the results are displayed for healthcare professionals, who can then make more informed decisions based on the AI-generated insights.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This entire process takes place rapidly and can significantly reduce the time it takes to diagnose diseases or perform complex surgeries, helping medical professionals provide faster, more accurate care.</p>
